  storyText: "Pushing with all your might you get past the iron bars, but with the
    hand tightening its grip on your ankle, you fall to the ground. Freshly arisen
    from the wet earth you stare at a half-decayed, blue-faced human with a cracked
    jaw. \r\n\r\nHe starts moving towards you. There is a mausoleum about 20 feet
    ahead of you you could try to break into. Or you could hide among the tombstones.\r\n\n\t1.
    Head to the mausoleum.\r\n\t2. Play some zombie hide-and-seek."
