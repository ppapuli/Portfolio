  storyText: "You pull your weight into a hard stomp and crack some of the assailant's
    bones. That slows it down enough for you to break free and look around.\r\n\r\nAhead
    there's a mausoleum with what looks like two levers on the outside. You also see
    a hut in the distance.\r\n\r\n\t1. Run to the mausoleum\r\n\t2. See if you can
    make it to the hut\r\n\t3. Hide among the tombstones"
