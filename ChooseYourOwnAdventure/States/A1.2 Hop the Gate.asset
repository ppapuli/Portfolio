  storyText: "\r\nFeeling particularly adventurous today, you roll back your sleeves
    and begin climbing your way up the fence. You make it to the top no problem, but
    as you shift your legs over, your shirt catches onto an exposed bar.\r\n\r\nAs
    you dangle from the top, you hear a shifting sound beneath you as a hand bursts
    from the dirt.\r\n\n\t1. Take your shirt off and jump down.\r\n\t2. Stay up here
    where its safe."
