  storyText: "You jog ahead, looking back at what appears to be a rotting corpse of
    a human. As it emerges from the earth, the faint moonlight reveals hungry eyes.
    It moves slowly towards you with intent. \r\n\r\nYou come upon the entrance of
    the mausoleum, two levers on either side of you. The door looks like it has a
    small crack near the opening.\r\n\r\n\t1. Pull the left lever\r\n\t2. Pull the
    right lever\r\n\t3. Examine the door"
